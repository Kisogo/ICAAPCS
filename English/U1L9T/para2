In "Crossroads: A Sad Vaudeville", authored by Guatemalan playwright Carlos Solorzano, a man waits for a woman to arrive at a train station after responding to her newspaper advertisement. The man is expecting her to be wearing a white flower on her dress, and although she is wearing it when she arrives, she removes it before she can be seen by the man. They converse, and when the man sees that this woman is not beautiful as the one he had seen in the ad, but aged-looking instead, he is convinced that she is a different woman. After a time, the woman boards the train again, and departs. A common theme in this play is appearance vs. reality. For the man, his idea of what the woman in the advertisement is like, and how she appears clouds his ability to see the reality of her. For the woman, her fantasy of the gentleman she had corresponded with in her letters is broken when she meets the superficial man behind the pen who is disarmed by her aged face. Both character's cognitive dissonance are expressed through their interactions. For example, after the woman gives the man her white flower from her purse: "MAN: Where did you get it? Why are you giving it to me? WOMAN: I picked it up . . . in passing . . . MAN: But then, she has been here. Perhaps she has gotten lost or mistaken the place. Or perhaps, while I was here talking with you, she has passed by without stopping. WOMAN: (covering her face) I already told you that there is but a moment to recognize oneself, to close one's eyes . . . MAN: But now . . . what can I do in order to . . . find her? WOMAN: Wait . . . as everyone does . . . Wait . . . (She takes the flower again.)" This is important to notice because it reflects and reinforces the idea of learning about ourselves through our neighbors. Both the man and the woman learned something about themselves through the opposite person, whilst coming from different backgrounds, and having very little similar traits as people.
