The statement "By discovering the literature of our neighbors, we may also learn about ourselves.", made by Kimberly Koza in "The Literature of the Americas" is applicable to literature we have read during this unit. One piece that shows exceptional relevance is "At the Tourist Centre in Boston" bu Margaret Atwood. She writes "Whose dream is this, I would like to know: \ Is this a manufactured \ Hallucination, a cynical fiction, a lure \ for export only?" in response to seeing an idealized photo of her origin country, Canada. in discovery of this American interpretation of her country, she is dismayed. Many Americans see Canada as their more polite neighbor, not dissimilar to themselves culturally, geographically, nor racially. Atwood rejects this interpretation, being a native of Canada. As much as she sees this as an American failing to perceive the reality of her country, she understands that this misinformation is partially one of Canada's own creation.
