PROJECT TITLE: Mondrian art and Recursion 
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Create Mondrian art to exercise the concept of recursion

4. My image was created by recursively subdividing containers into subcontainers (and subsubcontainers) before finally coloring them.

5. To write a program to generate Mondrian art, I would follow the same process as I did here. 
	1. Create a canvas.
	2. Subdivide the canvas into multiple sub-canvases of random size.
	3. Repeat step 2 until satisified.
	4. Color the canvases, using some sort of rule system.

6.
	b. If a computer, with no human intervention, produced Mondrian art indistinguishable
		from an original masterpiece, would it be a sign of artificial intelligence?

	A. No, computers are capable of generating thousands of random pieces of Mondrian art a second.
		Given an exorbant amount of time, the computer will eventually create something identical to an original. (See Infinite monkey theorem.)

<+s>: I had fun completing this assessment. I use i3, a tiling window manager. Instead of creating the image in an image editor,
	I created my image by opening pre-prepared images consisting of a single color using feh, in many individual terminal emulators. 
	I then used i3 to move the terminal emulators around, and resize them, before finally using scrot to take a screenshot.
      
<-s>: This assessment took a long time to complete.
